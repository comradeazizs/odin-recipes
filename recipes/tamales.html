	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Homemade tamales with homemade tortillas. Top with sour cream.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>5 pounds ground beef</li>
		<li>1 (4 ounce) can chopped roasted green chile peppers</li>
		<li>5 teaspoons hot pepper sauce (such as CholulaÂ®)</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
		<li>4 cloves garlic, pressed, divided</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon minced white onion</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
		<li>1 (2 pound) package yellow masa flour</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons lard</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
		<li>2 cups water, divided</li>
		<li>50 dried corn husks</li>
		<li>8 ounces grated Chihuaua cheese, or to taste</li>
		<li>5 tablespoons chili powder</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add beef, green chiles, hot sauce, salt, 3 cloves garlic, onion, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Cook and stir until beef is thoroughly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and reserve the drippings.</li>
		<li>Combine reserved drippings, masa, lard, and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix well. Add up to 1 cup water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until mixture is as thick as biscuit dough. Divide into 50 equal balls. Place dough balls between 2 cutting boards each lined with a sheet of waxed paper; flatten into circles.</li>
		<li>Place each dough circle into a corn husk. Spoon about 3 tablespoons beef mixture in a line across the middle of each husk. Top with a small amount of cheese. Fold opposing sides of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll the husk around the tamale and fold in one end.</li>
		<li>Combine the remaining 1 clove garlic, 1 cup water, and chili powder in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring chili sauce to a boil. Remove from heat.</li>
		<li>Stand a batch of the tamales, folded ends-down, in a steamer basket on top of a double boiler over simmering water. Bring water to a boil; cover and steam for 20 minutes. Remove tamales from heat; remove husks and top tamales with the chili sauce. Repeat with remaining tamales.</li>
